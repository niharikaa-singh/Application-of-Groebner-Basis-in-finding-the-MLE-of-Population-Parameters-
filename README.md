A point cloud is a collection of points of data plotted in 3D space, using a 3D laser scanner
If you're scanning a building, for example, each virtual point would represent a real point on the wall, window, stairway, metalwork, or any surface the laser beam meets.
Utilizing maximum likelihood estimation through algebraic methods, fit a plane to a given point cloud
